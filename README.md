<h2> Project Description </h2>
<p> The aim of the assignment was to use the Boto3 documentation to create a Python application which creates an AWS S3 bucket and uploads 5 images to this bucket. A new browser window should then be opened showing the images in this S3 bucket. </p>

<p> We decided to take the assignment a step further and develop a hosted web application using Flask, Python, Javascript, HTML, and DropZone.js which is an open-source Javascript library. This enabled us to create a website where images could be uploaded through the use of drag and drop and have their thumbnail / previews displayed before being uploaded along with the file size. When the ‘Start Upload’ button is pressed a loading bar is shown beside each of the images and a total loading bar at the top of the screen. Once the images have been uploaded the S3 bucket is automatically opened in a new window and the images are shown. </p>

<p> We decided to host the application on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) which uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption which is a protocol used for encrypting web traffic. This enabled us to ensure that users of the site had a secure connection and that there was a high level of data privacy and integrity during the file transfer. It also allowed us to have a HTTPS URL. The testing of the application is done through the use of requests to the API endpoints which enabled us to check that the bucket was created successfully and also to return the new contents of the bucket in XML format. This has been outlined in detail in our documentation.
